Today, I flew to Atlanta and met up with an old friend, who helped me go through and test all of my gear. Ashley. Because I shipped a lot of it to my parents place, this was the first time I was able to test my tent, my backpack and my water filtration system. We reconnected in my parents  yard while I fastened my tiny stove to the top of a fresh propane tank. I didn’t understand any of it, but a few YouTube videos later we were boiling water in a 300ml cup that would soon become my only piece of dishwater. Ashley has been a friend of mine for nearly two decades, and it was so exciting to include her in this adventure. We have, in one way or another, witnessed each other at our highest and lowest. And while those back in The City may have been attuned to the place this hike has in my life, Ashley could see it all as just another chapter. 

While in New York I was cocky and confident about my ability to survive on the trail, but with Ashley I was able to admit that I didn’t have any idea how the tent worked. Or the food. Or the water. And one by one we tackled them— testing the water filter, the tent and the sleeping pad. 

It looks as if I will begin my journey tomorrow. Sure, I have registered with the trail association, but the mountains themselves don’t take appointments. They are attuned to a different clock.
