# About

When I was thirteen, once a week at summer camp, we would have a "Cabin Night." Ironically, this was the night when all the boys in our cabin would hike down to a shelter in the woods, lay out our sleeping bags, and camp in the open air. We were in the mountains of North Carolina. Nighttime there was loud, and while we were usually sheltered by the walls of a bunkhouse, this night gave us front-row seats to the cadence of bugs, frogs, grasshoppers, and cicadas.

My cabin mates and I would cook chicken and vegetables wrapped in tin foil, tossed onto the coals of the fire, play card games, and wait for the sun to set. Then we’d lay out on the concrete and listen.

To me, the sound was overwhelming. I couldn’t believe that somewhere so remote could be so loud. I imagined the throats of the bullfrogs, sore and reddened. How could such a small animal make such a loud sound? It seemed painful.

I never slept well on those nights. But now, those same sounds snap me back to being thirteen in an instant.

Since then, I’ve grown accustomed to all sorts of noise in Brooklyn. Noise that is even more strained and urgent than that of the bullfrog. Sirens, sure, but also voices—brief moments of chanting or laughter coming from the windows. (The man who lives next to me has an especially distinct and piercing sneeze.) But there’s something missing from the music of the city. Yes, something natural, but also something older than my own comprehension.

City noises are cutting-edge. They’re new and exciting. They speak of civilization, technology, and progress.

But sometimes they sound so juvenile when played against the sounds of a mountain range billions of years old. The croaking in the woods, the cicadas, and the grasshoppers—it’s an ethereal standard. A song that’s been fine-tuned for an unbelievably long time.

It’s both innate and ethereal.

I miss it greatly.

On a rainy morning in 2009, my mom, my brother, and I set off into the North Carolinian wilderness to find something we had read about—a mythic connection to the Appalachian Trail. At the time, we were somewhat intermediate hikers, going from peak to peak around North Carolina. Whiteside Mountain, Rainbow Falls, and, ironically, Amicalola Falls would set the backdrop for a lifetime of East Coast hiking.

That day, though, we were venturing down an unmarked trail just down the road from where we were staying. Apparently, this was a popular connection point for through-hikers navigating the soggy peaks, passes, and valleys around Sapphire. With nothing but word of mouth and a trail marker, we pushed back the heavy rhododendron brushes to reveal an ill-marked path that led about a mile down the mountain into a creek bed. This trail was nothing like the structured, well-marked trails we were used to. Markers were sparse. The woods were dense. And as we got closer to the water, it became harder to hear one another over the sound of the underbrush.

At a certain point, we found ourselves between markers, and then the markers just disappeared. We were lost. My blood sugar was dropping, and I dragged my feet.

For a moment, we feared what it would mean if we were stuck out there.

We took a break by the raging stream before trying to find our way back up. I squatted with my arms over my knees and imagined a through-hiker. I imagined filling up a bottle from the stream and filtering the water to drink. I imagined putting down my backpack, laying in the middle of the trail, pitching a tent with a view of the stream, and waiting for night to come. And in the morning, I would wave it goodbye and take off.

This image has lingered in my mind in some form or another for the last 15 years. I still share that feeling of contentment I had as a young child in the Appalachian woods. They will always have a familiarity to them. And though they remain indifferent to my presence, I miss them every time I leave and hope that not too much time passes before I can hike again.

Then again, it’s not hard to see now, as a man in his twenties with a desk job, what would be so appealing about the trail.

I created this website to log my journey on the trail, though success is far from guaranteed. An ankle twist on day two could put a damper on things entirely. And though I approach the trail with great excitement, I will do my best to accept that there are some things out of my control.

Hopefully, that alone will be a sufficient moral, but I promise I will be extra careful.

I will spend the next five weeks hiking the trail, should nature allow. I will sleep on the ground. I will eat mostly freeze-dried provisions. And yes, I will poop in a hole in the ground that I dug myself. I will say goodbye to the comforts I work so hard for and cling so tightly to. And I will rely on my own exhaustion to keep me asleep at night—or so I hope.

I always find myself happiest coming out of the woods and taking stock of what I’ve missed the most. It’s a wonderful way to tell what’s truly important.

I am so lucky to have people in my life who, though they may not understand it, encourage this dream. So if you are a friend, a coworker, a family member, or someone I don’t even know, I keep this log as a gift to you—to inspire you to dream, to pursue, and most importantly, to wander.

I hope I am as tough as I am brave.
