# About

When I was thirteen, once a week at summer camp we would have a "Cabin Night". This night, ironicly, was the night that all of the boys in our cabin would hike down to a shelter in the woods, lay out our sleeping bags, and camp in the open air. We were in the mountians in North Carolina. Nighttime there was loud, and while normally we were sheltered by the walls of a bunkhouse, this night we would have front row seats to the cadance of bugs, frogs, grasshoppers and cicadas.

My cabin mates and I would cook chicken and vegitables wrapped in tin foil thrown against the coals of the fire, play card games, and wait for the sun to set. Then we laid out on the concrete and listened.

To me, the sound was blaring. I couldn't believe somewhere so remote could be so loud. I imagined the throats of the bullfrogs, sore and reddened. How could such a small animal make such a loud sound? It seemed painful.

I never slept well on those nights. But now, those same sounds snaps me back to age thirteen in an instant.

Since then, I have grown accustomed to all sorts of noise in Brooklyn. Noise that is even more strained and urgent than the bullfrog. Sirens, sure, but also sometimes voices. A brief moment of chanting or laughter coming from the windows. (The man that lives next to me has an especially distinct and piercing sneeze.) But there is a certain thing missing from the music of the city. Yes, something natural, but also something older than my own comprehension.

City noises are cutting edge. They're new and exciting. They speak of civilization, technology and progress.

But sometimes it sounds so juvinile when played against the sounds of a mountian range billions of years old. The croaking in the woods, the cicadas and the grasshoppers. It's an etherial standard. It's a song thats been fine tuned for so long. Unbelievably long.

It's both innate and ehterial.

I miss it greatly.

On rainy morning in 2009, my mom, my brother and I set off into the North Carolinean wilderness to find something that we had read was closeby. Something mythic: The Appalachian Trail. We had become somewhat intermediate hikers at that time, going from peak to peak around North Carolina. Whiteside Mountian, Rainbow Falls and, ironicly, Amicalola falls would set the backgrop for a liftime of East Coast hiking.

Today though, we were venturing down an unmarked trail just down the road from where we were staying. Apprently, this was a popular connection point for through-hikers going through the soggy peaks, passes and valleys around Sapphire. With nothing but word of mouth and trail maker, we pushed back the heavy rhododendron brushes to reveal an ill-maked path that went about a mile down the mountian into a creekbed. This trail differed greatly from the structured, earmarked trails we were used to. Markers were sparce. The woods were dense. And as we got closer to the water, it became harder to hear one another in the underbrush.

At a cerain point, we were in between markers, and the markers just dissapeared. We were lost. My blood sugar was dropping, and I dragged my feet.

For a moment, we feared what it would mean if we were stuck out there.

We took a break by the raging stream before trying back up. I squatted with my arms over my knees, and I imagined a through-hiker. I imagined filling up a bottle from the stream and filtering the water to drink. I imaged putting down my backpack, laying in the middle of the trail, and pitching a tent with a view of the stream, and waiting for night to come. And in the morning, I would wave it goodbye and take off.

This image has lingered in my mind in some form or another for the last 15 years. I still share that feeling of contentment that I did as a young child in the Appalachian woods. They will always have a familiarity to them. And though they remain apathetic to my presence, I miss them every time I leave, and hope that not too much time passes before I am able to hike again.

Then again, it's not hard to see now, as a man in his twenties with a desk job, what would be so appealing about the trail.

I created this website to log my journey on the trail, though it is far from garunteed. An ankle twist on day two could put a damper on things entirely, and though I approach the trail with a great excitement, I will do my best to accept that there are some thigns out of my control.

Hopefully, that alone will be a sufficient moral, but I promise I will be extra careful.

I will spend the next 5 weeks hiking the trail, should nature allow. I will sleep on the ground. I will eat a bunch of freeze dried provisions, And yes, I will poop in a hole in the ground which I dug myself. I will say goodbye to the comforts that I work so hard for, that I cling so hard to. And I will rely on my own exhaustion to keep me asleep at night. Or so I hope.

I always find myself happiest coming out of the woods and taking stock of what I have missed the most. It's a wonderful way to tell whats truly important.

I am so lucky to have people in my life who, though they may not understand it, encourage this dream. So if you are a friend, a coworker, a family or someone I don't even know, I keep this log as a gift to you-- to inspire you to dream, to persue, and most importantly, to wander.

I hope I am as tough as I am brave.
