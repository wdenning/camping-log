Today I took a beautiful hike in the woods.
    
I didn’t sleep very well last night. I kept waking up, thinking about sleeping in the woods. When I finally got up, I stepped outside in my underwear to peel my only set of clothing off the ground. I had treated it overnight with permethrin—a chemical spray that helps keep ticks away.

My parents drove me to Amicalola Falls, the unofficial start of the Appalachian Trail. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy recommends that hikers start there at the falls, where there’s a nice visitor center and lodge you can stay in. The official start of the AT, though, is nearly 9 miles away, at Springer Mountain. We drove to the lodge and had [brunch there](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B1qGDdyTv8aak9;20733B9F-4584-4EFC-A93C-9F5D5874546B), overlooking the mountains. We ate while watching hawks fly past the window.

My dad has developed a special interest in murders on the AT, so I made sure to go over all the things I’d do in different scenarios. A little morbid, but it helped him feel reassured.

Then we went down to the visitor center, where I had registered to start the AT. I was hoping to receive one of those cool AT tags to hang on my pack—I thought it would be a good conversation starter. Turns out, they were out. And they didn’t have a scale to weigh my bag, either. Still, just being there with my family felt meaningful enough. We stepped outside to take pictures in front of the arch.

The first leg of the trail is a grueling coil of staircases straight to the top of the falls. I haven’t hiked with a pack this heavy before, and I quickly began to sweat. I wasn’t surprised that it was hard—but knowing it’s going to be hard doesn’t make it less hard. I thought about the book A Walk in the Woods, where two campers start with way too much gear—including a six-pack of beer. Hilarious. I can barely carry a twelve-pack from the grocery store to my apartment.

There were a lot of families visiting the falls, but none of them had backpacks. While I was struggling to make it through my first 1,000 feet, they were taking breaks and photos. I secretly hoped someone would ask me about my backpack, but no one did.

Once I passed the top of the falls, the crowds thinned almost immediately. I didn’t see anyone for the next 45 minutes or so.

The first group I did come across was heading in the opposite direction—about 16 men and women in their 60s. They had small backpacks, just enough for food and water, but no tents. I stopped to ask if they were hiking the AT. They all had trekking poles and looked pretty athletic.

One of them told me they were section hiking the AT but staying in hotels the whole time. They alternate the direction of their hikes so that they’re always going downhill.

I wish I had thought of that.

I told them I was heading up to Virginia, and that if they were hoping to get tags, the visitor center was out.

The next guy I came across was definitely a camper. He was sitting on a stump with his backpack on the ground and looked like he was in rough shape.

“Hi, are you hiking the AT?” I said—I came on strong, excited to meet another camper.

He said he was. It was his first day, too. He’d woken up at 3 a.m. to drive up here and start, and he didn’t think he’d make it to Springer.

The next man I met was an enthusiastic hiker in his fifties. We had the same GPS system, and he told me I should set it to send my location every two hours to save battery

Because of my dad’s trail-murder talk, my first thought was: “How far could you get with a body in two hours?”

I ate a chia gel, a pack of trail mix, and a bunch of rice cakes while walking. I drank most of my water and used my map to locate a creek to refill. I stared at [this sign](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B1qGDdyTv8aak9;5204307F-5526-44E8-A951-7FDAA05FB5D0for) for a long time like it was a museum piece. I love how frank it is.

Please enjoy this video of me, so proud after filtering my own water. I didn’t dare film myself the first time I tried—it’s just as well, because I accidentally scooped up a chunk of dirt while trying to fill my bottle.

I leaned over to read a map and scraped my shin. I had to dip into my first aid kit earlier than expected  

As I pulled out my Band-Aids, I thought back to when I was a Cub Scout. It was a rite of honor to have a pocket knife. On our camping trips, we’d sit around the fire shaving sticks into spears. My parents were deeply concerned about the knife and constantly reminded me to use it safely. That’s why, after slicing my finger pretty badly, I immediately wrapped it in a wad of Band-Aids and hid it. Later, I would quietly hold back tears as I peeled off the dirty, matted dressings.

When I got to the campsite, I pitched my tent and immediately started cooking with my [teeny tiny stove](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B1qGDdyTv8aak9;F7DB5165-386D-44BF-B2FB-045195E9976D).

I felt pretty good after hiking 9 miles today. The one thing I need, though, is a hip strap that actually fits my bag. The off-brand one I got doesn’t hook on properly and is basically useless. There’s an outfitter 30 miles from here—I’ll see if they can help me get some hip pads. Luckily, my pack is light enough that it doesn’t feel too bad on my shoulders.

I have two options tomorrow. I could hike to Lance Creek Restoration Area, which would be 13 miles. Beyond that is a stretch of trail that’s heavily trafficked by bears, and a solid bear container is required. I don’t have one—and I don’t really want to sleep anywhere with high bear activity—so I plan to hike straight through that section without camping. The next site past that is Bull Gap, at 17.7 miles.

I’ll decide on the distance once I get to Lance Creek. I don’t plan to resupply until I reach the outfitter in 30 miles. I have plenty of food to last until then, and I’m looking forward to my pack getting lighter with every meal.

I hope I sleep well tonight—the weather has been perfect.
